# Reenvisioning-the-comparison-between-Neural-Collaborative-Filtering-andMatrix-Factorization

Configuration file, models and basic script to reproduce in Elliot the experiments from the paper: _Reenvisioning-the-comparison-between-Neural-Collaborative-Filtering-andMatrix-Factorization_

#### Preliminary steps

- Clone repo or download Elliot from here
- Copy all folders and files from our repo into Elliot folder

### Replicate all baselines performance

The results of Table 1-3 and Figure 2-3-4 were generated with this following lines

Movielens:

```pyhton
pyhton experiments_ml1m.py
```

Pinterest:

```pyhton
pyhton experiments_p20.py
```

All hyperparameters and configuration details for each models are placed into configuration files folder: respectively `recsys_config_movielens.yml` and `recsys_config_pinterest.yml`.

These experiments generate all needed files to execute the overall evaluation to receive all performance and statistical significance tests.

To execute the complete evaluation run the following script

```pyhton
pyhton evaluation.py
```

This script is driven by the file named `test_config.yml`. Edit the placeholder path in this file to change the reference dataset.

### MF vs NeuMF

The results of the first and third column of table 2 and highlight points in figure 1 were generated by running these scripts
